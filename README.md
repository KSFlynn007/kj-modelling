# kj-modelling

## Packages Used
1. Bootstrap v.5.0.2 via CDN, no jQuery
2. [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) v.7.0.2

## Requests
Client requested the following:
1. Small web application to act as Instagram replacement to send to model bookings
2. Mo personal contact info (phone number, email), only a contact form to send booking info
3. Primarily focused on images
4. Client did not want to pay for custom domain or hosting fees.

## Design Process
1. I originally put together a rough [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/q1PXN0xGMY29Svv9biukEH/kj-modelling?node-id=4%3A66) file for the client to view remotely.
2. She liked the colors used and the basic content, but wanted to make eveything horizontal vs. vertical.
3. I found that a simpler design looked more aesthetically pleasing, less "cartoony" and much easier to make responsive to all devices, and the client agreed.
